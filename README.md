A single-binary ðŸŒ¯ wrapper around `docker compose` with embedded configurations to effortlessly run your local observability stack.

The underlying observability stack is built on [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) products and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). It includes the following services:

* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/)
* [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)
* [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/)
* [MinIO](https://min.io/)
* [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/)
* [Prometheus](https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/)


## Prerequisites

`run-o11y-run` depends on the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes the `docker compose` command.

## Quick Start

### Install

#### brew

Install [brew](https://brew.sh/) and then run:

```sh
brew install krzko/tap/run-o11y-run
```

#### Download Binary

Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/krzko/run-o11y-run/releases) page.

### Run

* Run `run-o11y-run`
* Configure your service to push telemetry data to one of the following endpoints. This can be done by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable or updating your config file. Make sure to set the traffic to **insecure**:
    * OTLP (grpc): http://localhost:4317
    * OTLP (http): http://localhost:4318
    * Jaeger: http://localhost:14268
    * Zipkin: http://localhost:9411
* Logs are procedd via two means:
  * Tailed from `/var/log/*.log` and `$(PWD)/*.log` on your local machine.
  * A Syslog RFC 3164 header format, `syslog` receiver operates on `localhost:8094`
* To exit gracefully, press `CTRL+C`.
